Aehter uses an open skill list. This means, that, by default, there is no certain set of skills to be trained (if a GM likes a certain skill list, he can still impose it). You can train any skill you like, by just taking the corresponding skill feat. Each skill feat gives a +2 bonus to the chosen skill. 
<p>
Some skill feats may have requirements on their corresponding ability scores (e.g. Dexterity for 'Disable Traps' or Attunement for 'Mysticism'). A skill feat basically gives a character the knowledge, how to approach certain problems. The physical or mental prowess to actually do these things are then represented by those requirements. This imbues the fact, that you should consider training your Strength checks, instead of taking a skill feat for something like 'Athletics', as there is barely any knowledge implied (similar for other ability checks). 
</p> <p>
Open skill list implies an extreme range of possible skills. It might happen, that a GM requires a certain skill check, for which your chosen skill is not completely sufficient, but still does make some sense to use. In this case, you can use half of your bonus on that skill to roll for the necessary skill check.
</p> <p>
When using an open skill list, it is quite possible to have a character, who has 'Knowledge: Nature', while the other has 'Knowledge: Bears'. Of course, these have to be evaluated extremely different. If there is an appropriate check for Knowledge:Bears, the character with this type of knowledge basically always succeeds on the check, as he is explicitly trained in this type of knowledge, while the character with 'Knowledge:Nature' does have to succeed on a certain check. On the other hand, the person with 'Knowledge: Nature' can ponder about weather or other nature-related things, which the specific knowledge over bears can't provide.
