	<p>
	A character's raw physical power and muscles are measured with the Strength ability score. It determines the (or at least a part of the) damage of most weapons. Especially the damage of melee weapons often have a strong dependancy on the character's strength score. Stength is needed for many weapons to become more proficient with them. Also, when using a shield, this ability score is quite helpful. On top of that, some special combat abilities are become accessible when having enough strength.
	</p>

	<p>
	Strength also directly influences the amount of weight you can carry (<a href="../SecondaryAttributes/CarryCapacity.html/"> &rarr;Carry Capacity</a>).

	<h3 id="BonusBaseDamage"> Base Damage </h3>
	This increases the base damage of any weapon you use by the given amount. This only counts for physical attacks (e.g. if you have a wand or staff, which shoots magic bolts, it does not count. If you punch people with that weapon, it does count.) and also applies for ranged attacks. The only exception are cross bows, which are not influenced by this value (again, unless you punch with your cross bow). 
	</p> <p>

	<h3 id="BonusDodge"> Block Bonus </h3>
	More dexterous characters are more adept at dodging. You gain a bonus on all dodge rolls.
	</p> <p>
	
	<h3 id="BonusParry"> Parry Bonus </h3>
	Strong characters are more adept at parrying attacks with their weapon. You gain a bonus on all parry rolls (independent of proficiency).
	</p> <p>

	<h3 id="PowerAttack"> Power Attack </h3>
	Power Attack is a combat skill. It modifies your normal attack, so for all intents and purposes, count it as a normal weapon attack (still takes your weapons attack time number of ticks to attack, etc.). The higher your Strength score is, the more advanced this quite brute method becomes in your hands.
	</p> <p>

	I) Whenever you make a melee attack, you can choose to take a -2 penalty on your attack roll. If you do, your weapon deals an additional damage dice of its type (if it has 1d6 as damage dice, you get an additional 1d6 for damage). This modification costs two stamina and has do be applied per attack, not per round (if you make two attacks in a round and want both to be modified by Power Attack, you have to spend 4 stamina in total and get -2 on each of the attacks). When using a two-handed weapon, it instead costs three stamina per attack.
	</p> <p>

	II) Whenever you use Power Attack, increase the damage dice of you weapon by one step (1d4 &rarr; 1d6 &rarr; 1d8 &rarr; 1d10 &rarr; 1d12, analogous for 2d4 etc.). 
	</p> <p>

	III) Whenever you successfully deal damage with an attack modified with Power Attack, the opponent is staggered by the impact (he loses two ticks in his next round). If the attack is a critical hit, the opponent is stunned in addition to the loss of ticks.
	</p> <p>

	<h3 id="Charge"> Charge </h3>
	I) As a six-tick action, you can move up to three times your movement speed and make an attack against a target to which you have line of sight. You get a +2 bonus on the attack roll made this way. The movement has to have a straight, obstacle free path and has to be at least two fields long. It has to end in the closest space from which you can attack the oppoenent (if tied, you can choose). For Charge, allies count as obstacles. This action costs four stamina and does not work with spell attacks.
	</p> <p>
	II) When using Charge, your attack is counted as if using Power Attack. This does not increase the stamina cost of this action.
	</p> <p>
	III) You ignore any moveable obstacles of your size or smaller when charging. These objects are knocked away (slightly, they do not change the field they are on) and do not count as obstacles when making a charge. Large obstacles or creatures still prevent you from charging.
	</p> <p>
	In addition, you can make an attack against any opponent in your line of charge (or adjectant to it) in addition to the one made against your charged target.
