	<p>
	Your physical toughness is tracked by your vitality. The more vitality points your character has, the more total hit points he has (which is generally useful for all characters). Whenever a character gains a point in vitality, he/ she rolls a (or several) dice(s), depending on the vitality score reached, and adds the result to his total hit point pool. In addition, for each level a characer gets, he adds one hit point to his hit point pool. More information on a characters health is can be found under <a href="../SecondaryAttributes/HitPoints.html/">&rarr;Hit Points</a>). 
	</p>
	<div class="alert success">
  		<span class="closebtn">&times;</span>  
  		<strong>Example:</strong> A character with a vitality score of 8, who is level 0 wants to determine his total hit points. He therefore rolls 8d4 (e.g. 3-4-4-1-2-4-3-2), adds them all up (23) and adds his level (still 23). The total hit points the character has is 23. Now this character gains experience and reaches level one. He decides to increase his dexterity score, because he wants to play an agile character. He still gains one total hit point, increasing his health pool to 24. Some levels later (e.g. at level 8), he still has a vitality score of 8, but a hit point pool of 31. As he reaches level nine, he wants to invest a point into his health, and increases his vitality. He then gains 1d4 (rolls a 2) and adds one hit point (as he got a level) for a total hit point pool of 34.

	<p> </p> <p>
	Vitality also affects your resistance towards fortitude resistance checks (<a href="../SecondaryAttributes/FortitudeResistance.html/">&rarr;Fortitude Resistance</a>), which describes your characters resistance towards effects like diseases and poisons (among others). Also, characters with significant amounts of vitality get a natural resistance against damage of any type.
	</p> <p>
	Note, that this ability score applies for all creatures (undeads, constructs etc. are included). For non-living creatures, vitality still represents their sturdiness or effective health.
