	<h1> Resistance </h1>
	The resistance system is introduced to address many things, which cannot be handled with simple combat. This includes effects like poisons, diseases and exhaustion as well as things like charms or mental influence. There are three types of resistance checks:
<p>
<b> Fortitude Resistance </b>: Your Fortitude Resistance expresses your character's ability to withstand effects of poison and disease. It naturally scales with the character's Vitality score.
</p> <p>
<b> Pain Resistance </b>: Pain Resistance is exactly, what it sounds like. When a character is inflicted enormous pain (e.g. by a necrotic spell), this is your character's resistance to these type of effects. Additionally, it is highly important to overcome or delay the effects of exhaustion (both magical and physical) or wounds (see Fatigue, in <a href="../Dictionary/Status.html">&rarr;Status Effects</a>). Pain Resistance scales with a character's Endurance score.
</p> <p>
<b> Mind Resistance </b>: In order to avoid influence from effects such as fears, charms or mind control abilities, it is helpful to have a high Mind Resistance. It scales with a character's Willpower score. 
</p> <p>
<h3> Resistance Check</h3>
Whenever a spell or ability asks for a resistance check, you roll your d12 and add the score of your corresponding resistance to the result of the roll. The sum is the result of the roll. If your roll is higher or equal, the effect in question is prevented. If it is lower, you are affected by whatever was thrown at you.
</p> <p>
Note, that, whether you succeeded on the resistance check or not, for a certain duration (which is always indicated on the spell or ability thrown at you), all concurrent resistance checks get a malus (which is typically -1).
</p> <p>
<h3> Resistance Difficulty Class </h3>
The DC for a resistance check is determined by the attack itself. Depending on the source, it can either be a d12 + some kind of bonus - which is most often the case for a cast spell or ability - or just a fixed number (for some environment-related effect or other things which don't have a variance in the world).
