	<div class="feat_container">
		While wielding a bow, as a three tick action, you can move up to two fields away from an opponent, who is adjectant to you. You make a single attack with your bow against that opponent as part of this action. Evasive Shot does not allow for any reaction (besides defending against the attack) of opponents adjectant to your starting position. This costs 5 stamina.
