		Arcane Parry
	</div>
	<div class="feat_container">
		The character learns to parry spell attacks by influencing the flow of magic of any incoming spell. Whenever a visible spell is targeted on the character, he can make a parry attempt by spending 2 mana and making a parry roll. This parry roll uses the characters spell attack value instead of the parry value, but in all other intents and purposes counts as a parry attempt (thus costing stamina in addition to the mana cost.). The character can only attempt an Arcane Parry, if he has at least one free hand (this is treated in the same way as casting a spell, so if the character can cast spells without a free hand (e.g. via the 'Spell Combat'-Feat), he can also attempt an Arcane Parry).
