		Draining Arcane Parry
	</div>
	<div class="feat_container">
		The character is able to retrace the arcane source of a freshly cast spell. Whenever he successfully parries a spell using Arcane Parry, the caster / source of the spell loses additional mana in height of the spell complexity of the parried spell. If the Arcane Parry is critically successful, the spell's caster / source is shortly impeded in his arcane connection and thus cannot cast a spell during his next round.
